# yelpCampApp
App created with the help of The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

Not using ES6, unfortunately! Hope to refactor in the future.

Any user can view campgrounds without being logged in. To add/edit/delete a campground, user must sign up or login to an existing account. Users can only edit and delete campgrounds that were previously created by them. Comments can be added to any campground, as long as the user is also logged in. Flash messages provide information about recent events, including login, logout, errors, add, edit, delete, etc!

Uses: NodeJS, ExpressJS, PassportJS, Mongoose, MongoDB database, connect-flash, passport-local, method-override, body-parser.
